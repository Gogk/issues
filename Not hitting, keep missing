So, as Gogk, I've done SM exp train, even solo without ever an issue. Having a rune graven and all. But, on 9/11, 
after the reboot for range stuff. I noticed I wasn't hitting the same mobs as much. I noticed it on the second mob
Where I was missing 9-11 times before a single hit. I almost died, which never happens... at least during SM exp...
I wasn't hitting enough for the rune graven to vamp me up to continue the train.
Ohgma checked it out with me and witnessed the string of misses. Just thought you might want to know and check it out.

Thanks.
Love,
Gogk.
